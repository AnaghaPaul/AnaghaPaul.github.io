          How class and gender shaped survival outcomes during the Titanic disaster
        </p>
      </header>

      <!-- Introduction -->
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Titanic disaster is often remembered as a tragic accident, but survival was
        far from random. This project analyzes survival patterns to understand how gender,
        age, and passenger class influenced the chances of survival.
      </p>

      <!-- About -->
      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>
        Using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, this analysis explores how demographic
        factors affected survival outcomes. What began as a learning exercise evolved
        into an eye-opening example of how data can reveal social inequalities embedded
        within historical events.
      </p>

      <!-- Dataset -->
      <h2>Dataset</h2>
      <p>
        The dataset contains passenger-level information, including survival status,
        gender, age, and passenger class. These variables enable a detailed comparison
        of survival rates across different demographic groups.
      </p>

      <!-- Analysis -->
      <h2>Analysis & Insights</h2>
      <figure>
    <img src="images/titanic_image_1.jpg" alt="code" style="width:100%; border-radius:10px;">
  </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>Women had a significantly higher survival rate than men.</li>
        <li>Younger passengers generally had better survival outcomes.</li>
        <li>Passengers in higher classes had a clear survival advantage.</li>
        <li>Third-class men faced the lowest chances of survival.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Key Findings -->
      <h2>Key Findings</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Only 1 in 4 men survived compared to 3 in 4 women.</li>
        <li>First-class women had the highest survival rates.</li>
        <li>Social class amplified survival disparities across genders.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        This project highlights how survival during the Titanic disaster was shaped by
        societal norms and class structures rather than pure chance. The findings
        demonstrate the power of data analysis in uncovering hidden patterns and telling
        impactful stories about inequality.
