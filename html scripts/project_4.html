        <h1>Polysubstance Use & Mental Health</h1>
        <p>
          Exploring how patterns of multiple substance use relate to perceived mental health
        </p>

      <!-- Why This Study -->
      <h2>Why This Study Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Mental health is one of the most pressing public health concerns today, yet the
        relationship between substance use and mental well-being is complex. While many
        studies focus on single substances, real-world behavior often involves the use of
        multiple substances.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project investigates whether polysubstance use is associated with differences
        in perceived mental health, using a large-scale national survey dataset. The findings
        can help inform targeted interventions and evidence-based policy decisions.
      </p>

      <!-- Dataset -->
      <h2>Dataset</h2>
      <p>
        The analysis is based on the <strong>Canadian Tobacco and Nicotine Survey 2022</strong>,
        collected by Statistics Canada.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Type:</strong> National survey data</li>
        <li><strong>Observations:</strong> 12,133 individuals</li>
        <li><strong>Features:</strong> 88 variables</li>
        <li><strong>Key domains:</strong> Substance use, demographics, perceived mental health</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Study Aims -->
      <h2>Study Aims</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Cluster individuals based on substance use patterns and demographic characteristics</li>
        <li>Test the association between identified clusters and perceived mental health</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Methodology -->
      <h2>Methodology</h2>

      <h3>1. Data Cleaning</h3>
      <p>
        Survey responses such as <em>“valid skip”</em> and <em>“not stated”</em> were treated as
        distinct categories to preserve information rather than removing records.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Feature Engineering</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Removed redundant or unrelated variables</li>
        <li>Retained core substance use variables: alcohol, cannabis, smoking, and vaping</li>
        <li>Included demographic features such as age and gender</li>
        <li>Excluded variables that could introduce data leakage</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Unsupervised Modelling</h3>
      <p>
        Two clustering techniques were applied to uncover latent patterns in the data:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>K-Modes Clustering</strong> — optimal clusters selected using the
          Elbow Method and Silhouette Score
        </li>
        <figure>
    <img src="images/polysubstance_image1.jpg" alt="Returns" style="width:100%; border-radius:10px;">
    </figure>
        <li>
          <strong>Bayesian Gaussian Mixture</strong> — optimal number of classes
          determined using Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and Silhouette Score
        </li>
         <figure>
    <img src="images/polysubstance_image2.jpg" alt="Returns" style="width:100%; border-radius:10px;">
    </figure>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Models were trained on two datasets:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Substance use variables only</li>
        <li>Substance use variables combined with demographics</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Cluster interpretability was enhanced using <strong>Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA)</strong>
        for visualization.
      </p>

      <!-- Association Testing -->
      <h2>Association Testing</h2>
      <p>
        To evaluate whether the identified clusters were associated with perceived mental
        health, statistical testing was conducted:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Chi-Square Test</strong> to assess statistical significance</li>
        <li><strong>Cramér’s V</strong> to measure the strength of association</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Results -->
      <h2>Key Results</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>All clustering approaches showed statistically significant associations (p &lt; 0.05)</li>
        <li>Cramér’s V values ranged from ~0.08 to ~0.10, indicating weak but meaningful associations</li>
        <li>Including demographic variables altered cluster structure but did not eliminate associations</li>
        <li>Bayesian Gaussian Mixture models showed slightly stronger associations overall</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Interpretation -->
      <h2>Interpretation</h2>
      <p>
        While the measured associations were modest, this is expected in public health and
        social science research, where outcomes like mental health are influenced by many
        interacting factors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even weak associations can be highly relevant when working with large populations
        and complex behavioral data, reinforcing the value of clustering-based approaches
        for exploratory analysis.
      </p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        This study demonstrates that polysubstance use patterns are significantly associated
        with perceived mental health outcomes. By combining unsupervised learning with
        statistical testing, the analysis provides a nuanced understanding of how substance
        use behaviors relate to mental well-being.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a data analytics perspective, this project highlights the practical application
        of clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association testing on large-scale
        survey data to generate actionable insights.
