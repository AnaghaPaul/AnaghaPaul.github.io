    <h1>Apple Inc. vs S&P 500</h1>
    <p>
      A comparative financial analysis exploring risk, return, and diversification
      using historical stock market data.
    </p>
  </header>

  <!-- Introduction -->
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This project analyzes Apple Inc. alongside the S&P 500 Index to understand how an
    individual stock performs relative to the broader market. By comparing returns,
    volatility, and long-term trends, the analysis demonstrates fundamental investment
    concepts such as risk–return tradeoff and portfolio diversification.
  </p>

  <!-- Need of Study -->
  <h2>Need of the Study</h2>
  <p>
    Investors often face the decision of choosing between individual stocks and market
    indices. This study helps illustrate how a single high-performing stock like Apple
    behaves compared to a diversified index such as the S&P 500. Understanding these
    differences supports informed investment decisions and highlights why diversification
    plays a critical role in reducing risk.
  </p>

  <!-- Dataset -->
  <h2>Dataset</h2>
  <p>
    The dataset consists of historical daily stock price data for Apple Inc. (AAPL)
    and the S&P 500 Index (^GSPC), sourced from Yahoo Finance using the <strong>yfinance</strong>
    Python library.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>6,427 total records</li>
    <li>7 fields including Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume</li>
    <li>Time-series format suitable for return and volatility analysis</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Tools -->
  <h2>Tools & Techniques</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Python</strong> – core analysis</li>
    <li><strong>pandas</strong> – data manipulation</li>
    <li><strong>yfinance</strong> – financial data extraction</li>
    <li><strong>matplotlib</strong> – time-series visualization</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Data Preparation -->
  <h2>Data Preparation & Understanding</h2>
  <p>
    The analysis focused on the <strong>closing price</strong> of each asset, which was
    used to compute derived metrics such as daily returns. The data was inspected for
    missing values and consistency before proceeding to exploratory analysis.

  <h3>Rebasing</h3>

      <strong>Rebasing.</strong>
       Since Apple and the S&P 500 operate at very different price levels, rebasing was
    applied to normalize both series to a common starting value of 100. This allows
    direct comparison of relative performance over time, focusing on growth rather
    than absolute price.

  <h3>Returns Analysis</h3>

      <strong>Returns.</strong>
       Daily returns were calculated to capture short-term fluctuations and volatility.
    Analyzing returns rather than prices provides deeper insight into risk exposure and
    market sensitivity. The results show that Apple experiences larger and more frequent
    return swings compared to the S&P 500.

  <!-- Key Findings -->
  <h2>Key Findings</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Apple consistently delivers higher returns than the S&P 500.</li>
    <li>These higher returns come with significantly higher volatility.</li>
    <li>The S&P 500 demonstrates more stable behavior due to diversification.</li>
    <li>Major market events amplify Apple’s price movements more than the index.</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Conclusion -->
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    This project highlights the classic risk–return tradeoff in financial markets.
    While individual stocks like Apple may offer higher growth potential, they also
    introduce greater uncertainty. Broad market indices provide stability, reinforcing
    the importance of diversification in long-term investment strategies.
